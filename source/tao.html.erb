            <h2>Workflows, not Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              The HashiCorp approach is to focus on the end goal and workflow, rather than the underlying technologies. Software and hardware will evolve and improve, and it is our goal to make adoption of new tooling simple, while still providing the most streamlined user experience possible. Product design starts with an envisioned workflow to achieve a set goal. We then identify existing tools that simplify the workflow. If a sufficient tool does not exist, we step in to build it. This leads to a fundamentally technology-agnostic view â€” we will use the best technology available to solve the problem. As technologies evolve and better tooling emerges, the ideal workflow is just updated to leverage those technologies. Technologies change, end goals stay the same.
