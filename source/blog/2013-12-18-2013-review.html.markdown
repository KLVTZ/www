We're approaching the end of the first full calendar year of HashiCorp,
and it has been an incredible year in many ways. We wanted to share with you
what we achieved in 2013 and to briefly touch upon 2014.

In March 2013, after more than a year in development,
[Vagrant 1.1 was released](http://localhost:4567/blog/vagrant-1-1-and-vmware.html).
This was a monumental release in the history of Vagrant because it added
support for [providers](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html)
while maintaining
[backwards compatiblity](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/version.html).
Not a single file of the source code of Vagrant was left unchanged, and
this was the biggest release since the first release of Vagrant.

Today, we're at [Vagrant 1.4.x](http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/vagrant-1-4.html)
and there are providers for basically every platform out there. The adoption
of Vagrant and other providers has been much faster than we ever could've
imagined.

In May, we released a brand new tool: [Packer](http://www.packer.io). Packer
is already in use at many companies and is seeing rapid growth. While this
year was about releasing Packer, next year is going to be all about integrating
it with some of our other tools/products, existing and upcoming. Packer should
have a big year next year.

In June, [Vagrant: Up and Running](http://oreilly.com/go/vagrant) was publised,
becoming the first book dedicated to Vagrant. This has helped push Vagrant
adoption to new places. Following this book, another dedicated Vagrant book
was published by Packt.

In July, [Armon joined HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/armon--joins-hashicorp.html)
as a co-founder. He has been doing some amazing work, being primarily responsible
for [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io) as well as much of our upcoming products.

In October, we released [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io), our first server-side
component. While still very young, the popularity of Serf is growing, and
there are already a lot of interesting talks and uses of Serf in the wild.
The reason we built Serf was as a component that is used in some of our
upcoming products.

Going into the end of the year, we've been working on a lot of new things
for next year that you'll see announced early in 2014. What an amazing year for
HashiCorp, Vagrant, and our new tools.
