[Blake Walters](https://github.com/markupboy) is now an employee of
HashiCorp!

Blake is joining as a front-end engineer, the first full-time front-end
engineer at HashiCorp. While we've done our best, it certainly feels good
to have a professional take over and improve our front-end practices and style
throughout Atlas and our other projects.

At HashiCorp, Blake will be first and foremost improving the user experience
surrounding Atlas. Atlas is extremely JavaScript heavy and Blake is already
improving things throughout. We'll also be leaning on Blake's expertise to
improve some of our open source websites that require JavaScript/UX
expertise.

Prior to HashiCorp, Blake was a frontend engineer for Big Cartel where
he worked across the whole project but personally was responsible for
a big part of the seamless checkout as well as admin site. Prior to Big
Cartel, Blake worked for an agency and did work for Burger King, Epic Games,
Duke University, American Express, and more.
