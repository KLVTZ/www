[Blake Walters](https://github.com/markupboy) is now an employee of
HashiCorp!

Blake is joining as a front-end engineer, the first full-time front-end
engineer at HashiCorp. We've worked very hard to ensure that Blake is coming
into a well thought out and well engineered foundation, but having someone
come on board to focus on front-end full time will result in a huge improvement
across Atlas and our other projects.

At HashiCorp, Blake will be first and foremost improving the user experience
surrounding Atlas. Atlas is extremely JavaScript heavy and Blake is already
improving things throughout. We'll also be leaning on Blake's expertise to
improve some of our open source websites that require JavaScript/UX
expertise.

Prior to HashiCorp, Blake was a frontend engineer for Big Cartel where
he worked across the whole project but personally was responsible for
a big part of the seamless checkout as well as admin site. Prior to Big
Cartel, Blake worked for an agency and did work for Burger King, Epic Games,
Duke University, American Express, and more.
