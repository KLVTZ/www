At HashiCorp, James will be focusing on Consul and Serf as well as our
backend systems.

Prior to HashiCorp, James developed fault-tolerant avionics software at
SpaceX and got to be the operator saying "flight software is go" during
the first missions to the ISS. Before that, he oscillated between web
and embedded work, such as helping better share cat videos and
building systems to test radars. He lives with his family in Manhattan
Beach, adding to HashiCorp's growing group of folks in Los Angeles.
