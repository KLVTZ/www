We are excited to announce the publication of the first ever HashiCorp book in Japanese by one of our partners, [Creationline](http://www.creationline.com/en/).  The 120 page book presents a comprehensive view of the HashiCorp toolset, covering the use of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) for standing-up development environments, [Packer](https://packer.io) for automatically building machine images, configuration management using [Terraform](https://terraform.io), and [Consul](https://consul.io)/[Serf](https://serfdom.io) for automating service discovery.

This book was officially released on October 19, 2015 at an event in Tokyo where more than 50 people attended a book signing and launch ceremony with the author. The book ican be purchased from multiple [online stores](http://book.impress.co.jp/books/1115101039).
