Kevin is a self starter. Prior to HashiCorp, Kevin climbed from sales
engineer to Vice President of Growth by building an entirely new business unit
in just a year that brought in multi-million dollar revenues.
And prior to that, Kevin was the founder of his own company.

Kevin is another friendly face at HashiCorp. He'll be present and involved
with the community as we push forward some education initiatives.
