On behalf of myself, Jana, and the entire HashiCorp team, I want to say
"thank you" for an amazing HashiConf 2015. This post details some of the
highlights of HashiConf including the post-conference survey results.

It has already been a week since HashiConf 2015 first began, but we are already
hard at work planning for 2016! We have received overwhelmingly positive
feedback, and we are very excited to share them with you today. But first, some
housekeeping notes.

HashiConf 2015 was a global conference. We had speakers and attendees from many
countries around the world; some attendees reported 48 hours of travel time! The
map below shows the geographic breakdown of attendees by reported country of
residence:

The survey results indicated that most attendees were pleased with the food. No
one rated the food less than a 3 on a 5-point scale.

<sup>Please note that all of the following data has a
[selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) of people who
completed the survey. We did not collect demographic data during the ticketing
process. There we over 300 attendees at the conference and only about 30% of
the attendees completed the post-conference survey.</sup>
