On behalf of the entire HashiCorp team, I want to say thank you for an amazing
HashiConf 2015. This blog post details some of the key highlights including the
post-conference survey results.

It has been a week since HashiConf 2015 first began, but we are already hard at
work planning for 2016! We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback, and
we are very excited to share them with you today. But first, some housekeeping
notes.

All talks and keynotes were recorded. Our production company is editing the
videos this week and we will make them publicly available soon. We announced
exciting new updates to [Consul](https://consul.io) and
[Vault](https://vaultproject.io). We also launched two new open-source projects,
[Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) and [Otto](https://ottoproject.io). We have
written about many of these exciting updates already:
[Vault 0.3 release](/blog/vault-0.3.html), [Nomad announcement](/blog/nomad.html),
and the [Otto announcement](/blog/otto.html).

We had an amazing showing with over 300 attendees, speakers, and sponsors
joining us at the Gerding Theater on September 28, 2015. Thank you to all our
speakers and sponsors for helping to make this event a reality.

Select results from the post-conference survey are published in the charts
below. We are very excited to share the results.

_The following charts are interactive and may take a moment to load on slow

HashiConf 2015 was a global conference. We had speakers and attendees from many
countries around the world; some attendees reported 48 hours of travel time! Our
furthest attendees traveled from Japan, Estonia, and India!

The majority of HashiConf 2015 attendees who completed the surveywere between
31 and 40 years of age. The full breakdown is below.

The survey results indicated that most attendees were pleased with the food. No
one rated the food less than a 3 on a 5-point scale.

<sup>Please note that the previous data displays a
[selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) of people who
completed the survey. We did not collect demographic data during the ticketing
process. There we over 300 attendees at the conference and only about 30% of
the attendees completed the post-conference survey.</sup>
