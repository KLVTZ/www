At HashiCorp, Paul will be focusing on Terraform core as well as our
backend systems. We were pleasantly surprised to find a strong background
in systems programming in Paul's history; he wrote and ported an OS for
a couple architectures while in school and is very strong with C.
Given this background, he'll be working on some tough systems-level problems
we have in our tools and backend systems.

Prior to HashiCorp, when Paul wasn't writing an operating system, he
led a team responsible for ops and automation at a company that is one of
AWS's largest customers. During this time, he became familiar with working
at very large scale as well as working with almost every AWS service. He
is bringing this experience and wisdom to our toolset.
