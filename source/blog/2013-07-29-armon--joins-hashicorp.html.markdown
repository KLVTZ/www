Today is [Armon Dadgar's](https://github.com/armon) first day working at
HashiCorp. I went to college with Armon, convinced him to drop out of grad
school, worked with him at a previous company, and more, and I couldn't be
happier to have him join HashiCorp.

Armon is brilliant at making stable, scalable backend systems. He is the
author of [Statsite](https://github.com/armon/statsite), a C implementation
of Etsy's statsd that is able to push 10 million ops per second on a standard
MacBook Pro. He also made [bloomd](https://github.com/armon/bloomd) and
[hlld](https://github.com/armon/hlld), two high performance servers for
bloom filters and HyperLogLogs, respectively.

Needless to say, Armon makes really awesome things, and he makes them
_really_ fast. He is going to bring this skillset to HashiCorp as we build
out a lot of exciting stuff we hope to show you in the coming months.

Welcome Armon! Follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/armon) or
