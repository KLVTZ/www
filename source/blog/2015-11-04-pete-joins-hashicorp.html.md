At HashiCorp, Pete will be focused on the reliability, performance and
security of HashiCorp systems. We build tools for developers and operators
and dogfood them in our own environments extensively. By running our own tools,
we can use internal feedback to continuously improve our user experience, reliability,
and operational support. Pete's work will help both our Atlas customers directly
and the users of our OSS tools indirectly.

Prior to HashiCorp, Pete worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS). During his time
there, he worked as an engineer and manager on the S3 and Elastic Load Balancing
teams to increase the reliability of some of the largest scale services in the world.
His experience working with complex systems at scale will help us improve the
reliability of Atlas, and improve the underlying tools to assist operators
in production environments.

Pete lives in Shoreline, WA with his wife Bridgette, his son Max and their dog Shake
where on the rainy days you can find them playing Settlers of Catan or a classic
game of Life.
