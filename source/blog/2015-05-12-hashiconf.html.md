We're having our first ever [HashiConf](https://www.hashiconf.com)
September 28 and September 29, 2015 at the Gerding Theater at the Armory in
Portland, OR. HashiConf is a conference dedicated to modern datacenter
automation, from development to production.

The two day conference will have highly technical talks covering all
our tools: Vagrant, Packer, Serf, Consul, Terraform, and Vault. Talks will
range from tool introductions to advanced usage, and we'd like to invite
talks about any other tools in the ecosystem as well.

And without saying too much, the keynote is an event you'll not want to miss.

Join us for this two day event this fall with the entire HashiCorp team
and meet the smartest and most passionate HashiCorp users from around the
world. Let's experience the future of the datacenter together.

## Conference Format

HashiConf is a two day, two track conference covering datacenter automation
from development to production.

On both days, one track will be "Production." This track will cover all
things focused on maintaining a production infrastructure. This includes
Consul and Vault within the HashiCorp ecosystem, as well as topics such
as scheduling, containerization.

On the first day, the first track will be "Development," covering all
things development related. This includes Vagrant as well as any other
tools necessary to develop applications today.

On the second day, the first track will be "Operations." This track
will focus on operator tasks that don't necessarilly maintain the uptime
of production. This includes Packer and Terraform, as well as topics such
as continuous integration, deployment.

We're incredibly excited about this format. We'll focus on the full
problem of going from development to production, but will go into detail
about each step. There is something for everyone here.
