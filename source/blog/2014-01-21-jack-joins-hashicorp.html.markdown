is now an employee of HashiCorp! Jack lives in New York City and will be
HashiCorp's New York and east coast presence.

Jack will be working on [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com), specifically on
some upcoming enterprise offerings we have around it. Additionally, he'll
be working on some new projects we have to better build and embrace the
community around Vagrant.

If you've ever used [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com),
[Packer](http://www.packer.io), or [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io), you've
probably interacted with Jack at some point. He is very active on IRC,
the mailing list, and the issue tracker. He has also contributed to all
three projects.

Jack is also well known for his involvement with
[DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com). He created the single most
popular CLI to interact with DigitalOcean: [tugboat](https://github.com/pearkes/tugboat),
and also built and maintains the
[DigitalOcean builder for Packer](http://www.packer.io/docs/builders/digitalocean.html).
