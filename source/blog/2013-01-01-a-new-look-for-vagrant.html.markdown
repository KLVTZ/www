To kick off the new year, [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) has a brand new look! Vagrant has a new logo for the first time in three years, and the website is redesigned and restructured.

The new Vagrant logo is a simple "V" built up with isometric cubes. This matches the core HashiCorp style, visible on the [HashiCorp homepage](http://www.hashicorp.com). The old logo or mascot, known as "Vince," is now retired.

The [main website](http://www.vagrantup.com) has been completely redesigned and incorporates the new logo.

The main Vagrant website and the documentation site have been split into two different properties:[www.vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [docs.vagrantup.com](http://docs.vagrantup.com). While the main site has already been redesigned, the documentation site will be redesigned and restructured shortly.

Over the past three years, hundreds of pull requests have been opened to add content, fix typos, and clarify existing information on the Vagrant website. We want to continue to encourage this, so the new websites are both open source and welcome contributions.

You can find the repository for the Vagrant website [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/www.vagrantup.com). Since the documentation site redesign is still under way, the repository is not yet public. In the mean time, the source for the legacy website is still available for issues and pull requests [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant-docs-old).

The legacy "docs" and "gh-pages" branches of the main Vagrant repository are now defunct. Pull requests and issues about the website should now be opened on their corresponding repositories. Existing pull requests that were open against the site will slowly be transitioned.
