[Seth Vargo](https://twitter.com/sethvargo) is now an employee of
HashiCorp!

Seth is joining as both an engineer and an evangelist. As an
engineer, he'll be helping with both our
[open source projects](https://github.com/hashicorp)
and commercial offerings. As an evangelist, he'll be present
at meetups and conferences, and will help organize future HashiCorp events.

Prior to HashiCorp, Seth was at Chef, where he helped create
Learn Chef and [Omnibus](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus).
Seth is also highly active in the DevOps community, helping to
organize events such as
[DevOpsDays Pittsburgh](http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-pittsburgh/)
as well as being
a contributor to popular community projects such as
[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/).

If you're familiar with DevOps, you've probably interacted with
Seth at some point. If you use our tools, you'll begin to see Seth on
the mailing list, in IRC, and at conferences. And he'll be shipping some
new features to our existing software very soon!
