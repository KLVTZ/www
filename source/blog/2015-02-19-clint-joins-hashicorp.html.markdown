[Clint Shryock](https://github.com/catsby) is now an employee of
HashiCorp!

Clint is joining as an engineer. Clint is already a frequent committer
to [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io). Clint will continue to be working
on Terraform and the community will be happy to hear that his first task
is to expand our AWS support to near completion.

At HashiCorp, we expect the Terraform community to see Clint as a hero,
since he'll be spending a majority of his time stabilizing our providers and
expanding support to every resource imaginable.

Prior to HashiCorp, Clint was an engineer at Heroku, where he worked on the
team that is responsible for building every application pushed to Heroku.
This gave Clint an insight into distributed systems, the importance of
scalable infrastructure, and infrastructure as code.

Welcome Clint! Follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ctshryock).
