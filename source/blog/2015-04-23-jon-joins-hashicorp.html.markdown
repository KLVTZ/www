is now an employee at HashiCorp!

Jon is joining as our first solutions engineer. Jon has been working with
our tools for a few years and is now bringing that experience to end users
and customers to help them use more of our open source tools and also to
integrate these with [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com).

Growth in our user base has been explosive, including users from hobbyists
up to big enterprises. Jon will be focusing on the middle to the later range
of these users who have legacy concerns that want to adopt new technologies.
If you reach out to us about working with our tooling, you might just get
a response from Jon!

Prior to HashiCorp, Jon did a variety of things. He started out network
administrator and software developer, then got into product management,
then sales and account management, and then finally winded his way back to
being a software developer. This varied background gives Jon a great foundation
to interact with the various roles that our users take.

Welcome Jon! Follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jm_benson).
