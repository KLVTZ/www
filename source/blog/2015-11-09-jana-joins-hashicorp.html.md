At HashiCorp, Jana will be in charge of all events that we host and
participate in. In addition to large events like HashiConf, we want
to support community members that are organizing meetups as well as
hosting more of our own events. HashiCorp employees frequently attend
and present at conferences and Jana will help bring some method to the
madness.

Prior to HashiCorp, Jana was at NewRelic where she co-organized FutureStack13
the first NewRelic user and technology conference. She led FutureStack14
which had over 1200 people, 46 speakers, and 30 sponsors. Before that,
she worked at Prismatic, StackMob and Engine Yard. She has organized
meetup groups, hackathons, developer conferences, and private enterprise
focused events.

Jana lives in San Francisco with her boyfriend and two dogs, Cinderella
and Denali. She is an avid runner, and has run in the Honolulu and SF marathons.
She is also a yoga enthusiast, coffee addict and enjoys reading biographies and memoirs
about 60's and 70's musicians.
