Prior to joining HashiCorp, Jon (who goes by JT), was contracting for
HashiCorp. He met the team serendipitously as one of Mitchell's room
mates in San Francisco. He is famously a night owl and known to send
designs in the middle of the night.

JT is based in San Francisco, where he partakes in hot yoga, Javascript,
cold brew, colors, geometric shapes, kale juice and photography.
