At HashiCorp, Matthew will be working on the Atlas front end, bringing
his Ember expertise to bear. Atlas makes heavy use of client-side JavaScript
to create a dynamic experience. Matthew will work to enhance the user
experience, to provide the user with the most pertinent content, maximizing
responsiveness, and allowing users to drill into the state of their infrastructure.

Prior to HashiCorp, Matthew worked at Instructure, which provides software
for education. Previously to that, Matthew worked at Safari Books Online where
he worked on their web based reader, now the flagship product. The online reader
was heavily focused on user experience and building a more interactive experience
around the content which required building complex client side applications.

Matthew is located in the Kansas City area with his wife and two boys.
He is an art, beer, and coffee enthusiast and enjoys experimenting in
the kitchen.
