[Ryan Uber](https://github.com/ryanuber) is now an employee of
HashiCorp!

Ryan is joining as an engineer. He has already been a longtime contributor

as well as working on our upcoming commercial systems.

Prior to HashiCorp, Ryan has a long history of working on enterprise
infrastructures. Ryan worked for Cisco, where he built their internal IaaS
platform. He also built out all of the deployment tooling in use today
for WebEx, both on-premise and cloud. Before Cisco, Ryan built the
complete automated managed hosting platform at an ISP that included
building an image-based deployment tool over PXE for physical hardware.

Given Ryan's background of building homegrown versions of our own
tools through multiple companies, he was an obvious and perfect hire for us.
We're excited to have Ryan around.

Welcome Ryan! Follow him on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanuber).
