At HashiCorp. Justin will be working on backend systems for Atlas. You'll
start seeing features ship that he worked on within weeks. As time goes
on, it is very likely you'll see Justin more active in some of our open
source tooling as well.

Prior to HashiCorp, Justin was a traditional operator for 8 years before
switching to software development. This gives him a strong foundation of
IT knowledge to build on and a fierce drive to improve that world.
Justin is also the organizer of
[Software as a Craft](http://www.meetup.com/Software-as-Craft-Philadelphia/),
a meetup in Philadelphia, a panelist on
[Turing Incomplete](http://turing.cool/), a programming podcast, and is working on
new community-related events for the future.
